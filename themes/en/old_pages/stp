						<article class="comArticle">
							<p>Ruizean Markets uses Straight Through Processing (STP) for transactions on the market. Also known as “No Dealing Desk”, STP excludes human intervention, providing a very stable trading environment with lightning fast transaction speeds. </p>
							<p>Adhering to best market practices, Ruizean Markets customers receive transparent pricing with minimum trading spreads. STP allows the entire process to be conducted electronically with no background processing, giving customers access to profitable trades in real-time.</p>
							<p>Along with our deep liquidity, STP gives our customers high-quality live streaming quotes for global currency pairs at very competitive prices, as well as providing a highly stable environment and ultra-fast transactions.</p>
							<p>At the same time, the platform combines the international advanced ECN (Electronic Communications Network) technology, giving traders instant access to the foreign exchange and precious metals trading markets, rather than going through a third party.  </p>
							<p>This means that traders can avoid going through a market maker and can instead, place their own market orders, which are executed automatically. Traders enjoy not only the transparency of direct market quotes, but they also enjoy a smaller Bid-Ask spread and reduced slippage.</p>
							<p>One of the other advantages of using the STP trading model is that Ruizean Markets does not benefit from trading losses. Our profits come from direct commissions or the Bid-Ask spreads, so if you don’t make money, we don’t make money.</p>
